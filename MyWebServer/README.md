# My Web Server

As a distributed system to deal with the http stream between existing clients and servers, MyWebServer has below features:

1. Capture the HTTP protocol first-hand by developing some hacking / debugging skills (hacking in the good sense).

2. Return simple, static files on request from a browser client (e.g., txt, html, jpg).

3. Return dynamically created HTML (e.g., an error page, and a HTML page showing the current directory content).

3. Accept input from the user and do back-end processing on the server to return computed values in dynamically-created HTML.
