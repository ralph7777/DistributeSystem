    Concatenation of outputs from all five windows.

    Starting command:
    shell window 1: > java JokeServer
    shell window 2: > java JokeServer secondary
    shell window 3: > java JokeClient localhost localhost
    shell window 4: > java JokeClient localhost localhost
    shell window 5: > java JokeClientAdmin localhost localhost
    
    There are four parts of executions:
    PART A: run one server with one client, get eight jokes and eight proverbs
            showing they are given randomly and not repeated until all four.
    PART B: run a adminstration client to interleave Joke/Proverb Mode, showing
            client can maintain its state across mode changes.
    PART C: run a adminstration client to interleave mode for two clients, showing
            each client can maintain state independently across mode changes.
    PART D: run a adminstration client to interleave mode in two servers, while
            client switches connection between two servers to get jokes/proverbs,
            showing client conversation between each server is independent.  
    Every part of execution has output parallel in different windows.
            
    Noted that comments/annotations are added in Java comment form ("//" or "/**/"),
    i.e., they are not outputs of the program.
